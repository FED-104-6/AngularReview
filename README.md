# Readme

You are going to fill in these steps:

## Exercise 1:  
  
Clone this repository to your local system:
```
git clone https://github.com/FED-104-6/AngularReview.git 
```

Open it with your favorite code editor (VSCode, etc.).  
  
Create a new branch for your work:
e.g.
```
git branch feature/drew/git-repo-steps
```

Add some the following steps to the README:
  - How to create a git repository
  - How to save code changes
  - Adding a remote repository
  - Pushing the changes to the remote repository

This should be a step-by-step instruction set, similar to what we showed earlier during class time.  
  
You will create this on your own branch, then push it with your branc up to the Github repository, and create a pull request against the main branch.  
  
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
